**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
A minimal reproducible example to demonstrate the bug.

This could be a link to a (minimal) csasdown Tech Report, Science Response, or Res Doc folder on Dropbox, Google Drive, or GitHub that a developer can click the "Knit" button in RStudio and see the issue. This demo document should be self contained (not require any additional data files or figures or time-consuming R code to run). Ideally, you would create a fresh document (e.g. `csasdown::draft("resdoc")`) modify it as needed to demonstrate the issue and share that, noting what you changed from the blank template.

Alternatively, if simple, describe the steps to reproduce the behavior. For example:

1. Run `csasdown::draft("resdoc")
2. Go to line XX in file XX.Rmd and add or change `________`.
3. Knit the document.
4. See error `___________` or unexpected result in the PDF `___________`.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - Operating system: [Windows, macOS, Linux]
 - R version: [Find with `R.version.string`]
 - csasdown version: [Find with `packageVersion("csasdown")`]

**Additional context**
